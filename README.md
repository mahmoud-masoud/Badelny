# Badleny

Welcome to Badleny, the web app where users can exchange skills with others in a new, interactive way. Here's a breakdown of our features and sections:

## Home Page

The home page provides an overview of the website and its services, giving users an idea of what to expect.

## Login/Sign Up

Users can sign up or log in using their email and password. Upon signing up, they are directed to the SignUpForm page where they can choose the skills they have and the skills they want to learn. Additionally, they provide their age, gender, country, and phone number.

## Search

The search feature displays users who either possess or are seeking the skill entered in the text field. Each search result has a button that redirects to a chat page, allowing users to start communicating with each other.

## Suggestions

This section provides users with suitable matches based on their skills and preferences.

## Chat Section

Users can continue chatting with other users they've connected with through the search feature. The chat section also displays all contacts with whom they have previously communicated.
